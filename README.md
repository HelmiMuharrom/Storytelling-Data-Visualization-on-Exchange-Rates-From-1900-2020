# 📊 Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates 

This project is part of the Data Analyst and Data Scientist path on Dataquest. The goal of this project is to create effective data visualizations that tell a compelling story using exchange rate data. The project covers various visualization techniques and design principles, including choosing the right chart type, color usage, and layout design.

## 📊 Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains the daily exchange rates of various currencies against the Euro, from 1999 to 2020.Daria Chemkaeva put together the data set and made it available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020) 

## 📈 Analysis Steps

1. Data cleaning and preparation: This step involves cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing data and formatting the data types.

2. Exploratory data analysis: This step involves exploring the data to gain insights and identify patterns that can inform the data visualization.

3. Creating data visualizations: This step involves creating effective data visualizations that communicate the insights gained from the data analysis. We will be using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create our visualizations.

## 📊 Results

In that Analzye i share some intersting about Indeonsian Rupiah Against Euro at 20007-2009. Hence

After analyzing the dataset and creating data visualizations, we discovered the following insights:

- The fluctuation of IDR looks similar with the fluctuation of USD against Euro. Althoungh during 2015, Indonesian Rupiah showed a weakening value.
-upon further investigation, this weakening was due to the increase of foreign debt In Indonesia with mainly US Dollar denomination
- From the chart above, with the pegging of IDR to USD the two currency would response in similar patters against the fluctuation of the Euro.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- Matplotlib 📈
- Seaborn 🌊
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

Overall, this project is a great opportunity to learn how to transform raw data into stunning visualizations that tell a compelling story. By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in data visualization and develop valuable skills that can be applied to various data analysis tasks.
